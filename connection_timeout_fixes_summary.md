# Connection Timeout Fix Summary

## Resolved Issues

1. **Fixed BotServiceWrapper**:
   - Corrected method signatures to match BotService implementation
   - Fixed importKnowledge method to properly delegate to the underlying services
   - Removed non-existent methods that were causing errors
   - Added proper error handling for method invocations

2. **Fixed SubscriptionServiceWrapper**:
   - Added error handling for clearCache method in case legacy service doesn't support it
   - Used dynamic type to safely call methods that might not exist in the legacy service

3. **Fixed StreamZip implementation in SplashScreenExtensions**:
   - Replaced with a simpler _mergeStreams implementation that properly combines multiple streams
   - Fixed the opacity animation to use withAlpha instead of withOpacity
   - Ensured proper resource cleanup for all stream subscriptions

4. **Fixed SubscriptionService tests**:
   - Replaced Mockito with Mocktail for easier mocking
   - Added build_runner and mockito dependencies to pubspec.yaml
   - Created custom mock implementations for AuthService and Logger
   - Implemented proper HTTP client mocks for testing timeout scenarios
   - Fixed method signature mismatches in the test mocks

5. **General code cleanup**:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Improved error handling with graceful fallbacks
   - Added more detailed logging for debugging

## Files Updated

1. `lib/features/bot/services/bot_service_wrapper.dart`
2. `lib/features/subscription/services/subscription_service_wrapper.dart`
3. `lib/features/splash/splash_screen_extensions.dart`
4. `test/subscription_service_test.dart`
5. `pubspec.yaml`

## Potential Future Improvements

1. Make 100% certain the improved service implements all methods needed by the UI
2. Add more comprehensive unit tests for the wrapper services
3. Implement a monitoring system to track timeout frequency in production
4. Consider using a more robust HTTP client library with built-in retry capability
